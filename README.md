Phoneme Progression by Age – Animated Visualization (Slider Version)
This interactive web-based tool visualizes the typical MEAN AGE of acquisition of English consonant phonemes using a continuously adjustable slider. It is designed for students, clinicians, and educators in the field of speech-language pathology.

📊 What It Shows
A live-updated, color-coded bar chart of phoneme acquisition over time.

Each phoneme is grouped by manner of articulation:

Stops / Plosives

Nasals

Fricatives & Affricates

Glides & Liquids (with the same custom groupings as before)

The slider allows you to view phoneme mastery at fine-grained, month-level increments (with 0.1‑month resolution), spanning from 29.9 months (just below 2.5 years) up to 80.0 months (approximately 6.7 years).

Colors indicate mastery level based on well-defined thresholds:

🔴 Less than 50% of children have acquired the phoneme (displayed as “<50%”)

🟠 Mastery between 50% and 74%

🟡 Mastery between 75% and 89%

🟢 90% of children have acquired the phoneme

The interpolation is based on three key acquisition thresholds (50%, 75%, and 90%) as defined in the literature. Mastery is linearly interpolated between these levels and capped at 90%.

📁 Files Included
File	Description
index_slider.html	The main HTML file that launches the slider-based interactive visualization
phonemeThresholds.js	Contains the threshold ages (to one decimal place) for the 50%, 75%, and 90% mastery data
phonemeOrderByCategory.js	Custom order of phonemes sorted by typical acquisition age (unchanged from previous version)

🧠 Data Source
The age of acquisition data is based on:

Crowe, K., & McLeod, S. (2020). Children's English consonant acquisition in the United States: A review. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 29(4), 2155–2169. https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_AJSLP-19-00168

This page uses month-level detail (with 0.1‑month resolution) to dynamically interpolate phoneme mastery from 29.9 to 80.0 months.
